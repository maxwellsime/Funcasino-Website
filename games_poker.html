					Texas Hold Em</h1>
				<p class='p_normal'>Texas Hold Em is a popular 'comparing card' game where players compete with each other to get higher valued card combinations. Each player has two cards while there is 5 cards in the middle of the table - 3 revealed first in the flop, then 1 more in the turn, then the final card in the river. Inbetween each phase there is a phase where each player can bet or pass, if one player bets then everyone has to match their bet to continue playing - this is where the skill of the game comes in. Texas Hold Em' is a traditional psychological game of reading your opponents and understanding probabilities. Playing at home with a friend dealing your cards might be more relaxing however if you're looking for a professional atmosphere to play the game in then maybe you'd like a croupier. The single card values go in this order: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A. Winners of the turn/hand win the entire 'pot' which consists of all of the bets that have been made during that hand. If the last players all have the same value of card combination then the pot is split between them.</p>
				<p class='p_normal'>The game revolves around the card combinations and which combniations are better than others, so here is a table defining each possible hand with an example of each - shown weakest to lowest hand. A=Ace J=Jack Q=Queen K=King while S=Spades C=Clubs D=Diamonds H=Hearts (All card combinations can only be made by a player if the player already has one or two cards of the combination).</p>
