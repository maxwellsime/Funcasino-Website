					Dice</h1>
				<div class='grid'>
					<p class='normal'>A famous traditional dice game, also known as craps in America, where players bet on the outcome of 'the roll' which can also be a series of rolls of a pair of dice. In our funcasino you'll be playing casino craps and will be playing the game against the bank (our croupier). Players take turns being the 'Shooter' rolling the two dice while all other players are betting on the outcome of the roll. Players can bet by putting the poker chips given to them in the designated betting areas and at the end of each turn the winners will recieve the amount they bet times a certain number (see below). The game phases are explained fully below.</p>

							<p><b>Come out Roll:</b> After someone has been chosen to be the designated shooter they'll start their first roll with the 'Come out Roll'. The shooter <b>has</b> to place a bet on either the Pass or Don't Pass bets. A roll of 2, 3 or 12 is "craps" and all Pass line bets lose. A roll of 7 or 11 is a "natural" and the Pass line wins. Any other numbers will establish a point for the next round.</p>
							<p><b>Point:</b> After the first roll (phase) is over the point phase begins. After placing bets(see bets above) the shooter rolls again, this time if the shooter 'hits' a number with an established point from the first phase before rolling a seven the pass line wins and a new round starts. If the shooter rolls any seven before 'hitting' an established point then he has rolled a "seven-out" and the Pass line loses. After rolling a seven-out the dice is passed clockwise for the next shooter to start again at the Come out Roll.</p>
