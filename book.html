				<h2 class='h2_normal'>Fun Money</h2>
				<p class='p_normal'>Since our funcasinos aren't based on real money bets we use "fun money". Fun money is the free currency we use for our services and will be distributed earlier on in the night before we start dealing. Players with fun money can come up to any of the tables and cash the paper money in for chips to start playing. Each player has '100 pounds' worth of fun money each however can recieve more from friends or other people at the event freely to continue playing at our tables.</p>
				<p class='p_normal'>To make your event more unique, we can use specialised fun money made by us or supplied by you for an extra fee. Just make sure to mention that you want this for your event when you contact Graeme Sime.</p>
				<h2 class='h2_normal'>End night prizes</h2>
				<p class='p_normal'>Even though the fun money we use doesn't have any value, the last players at the end of the night will be able to 'cash-in' their chips to enter for the chance to win a prize(s). The prizes and prize system is usually decided by you, the event managers, however for an extra fee we can supply and handle prizes ourself to make your time easier. Just make sure to mention your preference for the prizes since we'll automatically assume that you'll be handling the prizes of the night - it's reccommended that some kind of prize is available for the end of the night so there is more incentive to play and enjoy the fun casino.</p>
				<h2 class='h2_normal'>Prices</h2>
				<p class='p_normal'>The price varies depending on the event's details and the amount of tables you want at the venue - base rates are: £350-300 for one table, with £150-100 for each table afterwards. We recommend two tables for most events and the base rates are flexible - especially for charity events.</p>
				<h2 class='h2_normal'>Ordering Template</h2>
				<p class='p_normal'>If you plan on ordering our services please use this template to make our interaction much easier for both of us. Using this is simple - just give an answer to all of these questions in the email you use when contacting Graeme Sime.</p>
