					Blackjack</h1>
				<p class='p_normal'>Blackjack is our second most common game and is a firm favourite. Blackjack is an American traditional casino game which has a large amount of varients including games 21 and pontoon. Blackjack is a 'comparing card' game where players compare their final and to the dealer's cards, with the objective to get a higher combination of cards up to 21. Go over 21 with your card combination and you're bust! Meaning you'll have to wait until he next hand to play. Aces cost <b>1 or 11</b>, while all picture cards cost <b>10</b>. The best combination of cards you want to look out for will be 'Blackjack' a combination of either a <b>picture card</b> or <b>10</b> card and an <b>ace</b> which gives the player 21 instantly.</p>
				<p class='p_normal'>Betting in Blackjack is very simple however there is two chances in the game to double your original bet.</p>

					<h2>Double Down</h2>
					<p>Doubling down on your hand is commonly known as "buying a card", you pay the price of your bet for <b>one more card</b> and no more. This can be used to attempt to get high hands while your starting hand is low (frequently around 10 in attempt to get 21).</p>
				</div>
				<div class='col-1' style='text-align:center;'>
					<h2>Split</h2>
					<p>Splitting your cards is only possible when you have a pair of cards the same number. This'll split your two cards into two hands for the price of your bet again. This'll be used frequently when you have a pair of good cards like aces or picture cards.</p>

				<p class='p_normal' style='text-align:center;'>Reminder: There is no insurance when playing Blackjack at our Fun Casinos.</p>
				<div class='games_phases'>
					<p><b>Betting:</b> Players will bet on one or more boxes on the table. This will be the first stage of the game and the croupier will wait until all players have bet.
					<p><b>Playing:</b> The dealer will go round the table giving each player the choice of how they want to play their hand. This usually consists of three options: Stand, not getting anymore cards and staying on the card combination that the player has; Hit/Card, getting another card from the dealer in attempt to beat the dealer's hand; Double down(See betting above). Sometimes splitting your cards is also an oppurunity (See betting above again).</p>
					<p><b>Paying:</b> Winners will be given double their bets while losers will have their bet taken away. However if a player has gotten 'Blackjack' (Picture Card/10 + An ace) then they'll be rewarded their bet twice, that is if they can beat the dealer's hand...</p>
